	who are u?
		my name is Tim 
		who are u?
			I don’t know
			What is there to do around here?
				There is lots of things to do around here, here take this map
Reads the map (picture of a map)
Where should we go?
	The mountains
The weather there can be really cold, you might want to find some warmer clothes before you go here
After a long walk you come to a small village, you see a guy standing outside of building and you go tlak to him
Hello, I am looking for some warm clothes do you know a where I can acquire some?
There is a tailor 3 doors down 
Thank you

# shop
You walk inside the shop
Hello, I’m going an adventure into the mountains and I need some warm clothes. The only problem is that I haven’t got any money
Hmmm, well I need some 3 new deer skins to make clothes and if you collect them ill make you your clothes for free. Do you accept?
	Yes
		Awesome, there is a forest not far from here you can go there 
		Thank you
		I will need something to catch some deer, what should I use?
			Spear
				Good choice, although it might be harder to the get close to the deer
After snapping of a solid branch and shaving a point into the end I jump into to watch for a deer to come by. 
…
…
…
After a couple hours I have only seen one deer and before I could get close it ran away
Maybe I should try something else
			Bow and arrow 
This might be difficult to make but I could use it after I get these deer on my adventure into the mountains
I cut a branch off a tree and make some thread from a flaks bush. I strip the flak leave into strips and weave it into a string
After making a few arrows as well I’m ready to go hunting
I sit up in a tree and a wait for the first deer to come by
…
…
After a while I see a deer, it slowly walks towards me as I take aim and release
The deer falls where it stands
I’m over the moon with exactment 
I sit back in the tree and after a while I get 2 more
I skin the deer and take some meat for the road and take the skins back to the tailor
…
…
…
The tailor makes me my new clothes and sends me on my way

			Trap 
This will be easy to catch a deer; I won’t scare them away and I can just sleep while it catches one for me.
After setting up the trap I go and lay under a tree to get some sleep
…
…
…
I come back to the trap in the morning and it is empty 
Maybe I should try something else
	No

# Desert
	The desert
		The desert is hot and dry. You might want to find a few water bottles to take some water with you, you don’t get dehydrated
			After a long walk you come to a small village, you go into a small shop.
			Hello, do u have any water bottles?
				Yes, how many do u want?
					1 or 2
						Ok that will be 20$
						Oh no I don’t have any money 
						Well why do u want them
						I am going on an adventure to the desert
						No u don’t want to go there, you’ll never survive
						If it is an adventure your looking you should go to the mountains
								
	The ocean
Your swimming ability isn’t great, head to the closest town and find boat
After a long walk you come to a small village, you go to the port and find a fisherman
			Hello, can I get a ride on your boat?
				Why do u want to a ride?
					I am going on an adventure across the ocean
					No u don’t want to go there, the ocean is harsh and dangerous place 
					If it is an adventure your looking you should go to the mountains

# mountain man
Time to find the next task
I see the same man standing a few doors down and go talk to him
I tell him how I am on an adventure into the mountains and ask him is there is anything I may need before I go there
He looks at me with a terrifying look
You know what’s in those mountains, don’t you?
	Yes, but do have anything else to tell me about it?
		There are dangerous beasts that live in those mountains 
		I even hear there is a dragon that protects the highest peak
		No man has ever come out of there alive		
	No
		There are dangerous beasts that live in those mountains 
		I even hear there is a dragon that protects the highest peak
		No man has ever come out of there alive
I would not even think about heading into those mountains without a sword 
There is a blacksmith in town he can make you a sword	
But I don’t have any money
Then you should go talk to the mayor he has some tasks that he will pay you to do
	You walk into the town hall and see the mayor
	Hello mayor, I hear you have some tasks that I can do?
		Hello Traveler, yes, I do what kind of task would you like?
			Collect food
				Awesome, we need some more fish for the village
				There is a river not far from here full of fish
				…
				…
				…
				After reaching the river I can see there is a few deep pools filled with fish
				Now I need to catch them, how should I catch them?
					Fishing rod
						Tying a few reeds together and then tying it to a stick should make a good fishing rod
						I can use some of the deer meat as bait
						I dangle the bait into the water and wait for something to bite
						…
						…
						…
						FISH ON!!! I yell as the rod is nearly yanked out of my hand
						I quickly pull on the rod and pull the fish in
						I do this for a few hours to get enough fish for the mayor
I went and talked to the mayor
Nice job, we really needed your help
Here you go +$500
 
					Net
						I find some reeds by the side of the river 
						I start to weave them together to make a net
						I throw the net into the river and pull it back in to see what I get
						…
						Nothing
						I keep trying again it does work great, but I eventually get enough
I went and talked to the mayor
Nice job, we really needed your help
Here you go +$500

					Trap 
						I pile rocks up below the deep pool in the river to make a small dam
I grab some reeds from the side of the river and weave it into a little basket and place it In the middle of the dam
I then walk to the top of the deep pool and thrash about to make lots of noise and scare the fish into the basket
I check the basket and it is full of fish
I went and talked to the mayor
Nice job, we really needed your help
Here you go +$500

				I arrive at the forest and start to cut down my first tree
				“russel” “russel”
