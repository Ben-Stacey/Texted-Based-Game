* The code needs to be restarted it rubbish and i already know it wont work

* The script is long i know but doesnt to be all read now just gives an indication on the timeline and decisions that can be made

* Every time there is an indent in the script it is considered to be an peice of text or context of story that happens within the previously chosen option from the player

## ToDo;
1. in the river crossing method need to have reset loop that lets you start again if you mess up
