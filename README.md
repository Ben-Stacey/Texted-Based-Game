* Every time there is an indent in the script it is considered to be an peice of text or context of story that happens within the previously chosen option from the player

* If you look at the flow diagram youll see there is the options mayor, mountain, ocean and desert. Each one of these will become a seperate story line that will lead back to a final battle

* once all 4 are complete them you do the final boss
